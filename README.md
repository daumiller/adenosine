adenosine
=========

ObjFW GTK+ wrapper

adenosine is an ObjFW specific, Objective-C wrapper for GTK+ 3. It's more than a binding, in that the normal gobject/GTK+ model is made more MVC-ish, and many methods and types are altered/added/removed/renamed.

##Status
adenosine is not yet complete, but can currently build some very basic applications.

##Dependencies
[atropine](https://github.com/daumiller/atropine) required (Cairo + Pango)<br/>
[WebKitGTK+](http://webkitgtk.org) if you want WebKit controls<br/>
[OFExtensions](https://github.com/daumiller/ofextensions) (which depends on PCRE) for example applications
